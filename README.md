# PkgsCleaner<br>
Read PKG and PKG recipe files, return uninstall-script for easy export as nopayload pkg or script.<br>
Use the Open menu to read from a PKG file.<br>

My first attempt to do a Swift app.<br>

## Todo<br>
- CLI version (to return a uninstallscript)<br>
- Drag n drop<br>
- Undo in textfield<br>
- Better Notification after export<br>
