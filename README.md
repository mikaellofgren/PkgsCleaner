# PkgsCleaner<br>
Read PKG and PKG recipe files, return uninstall-script for easy export as nopayload pkg or script.<br>
Use the Open menu to read from a PKG file.<br>
<br>
In my testing in returns a script in 10 sec for a big PKGs (like Microsoft Office).<br>

Always test your uninstall script before deploy.<br>

Hopefully its this saves your time when you want to uninstall any app or just to get a overview
over what a PKG install.<br>

Use Help menu - Open temp folder to see the open/expanded PKG included files.<br>

This is my first attempt to do a Swift app...Its open source so if anyone want to join, Im happy with that.<br>

## Todo<br>
- CLI version (to return a uninstallscript)<br>
- Drag n drop<br>
- Undo in textfield<br>
- Better Notification after export<br>
